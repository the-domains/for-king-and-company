            <description><![CDATA[<p>The more that I live life the more that I realize that we can get easily distracted with all of the things in life. I desire to make progress in areas of my life and the distractions of life can assuage me and take my eye off the ball of what’s really important. I realize just how important it is to simplify what I’m doing in my life. The idea of the balanced scorecard has been coming to my mind recently in the way that I’ve been appreciating simplicity. I think the reason that many of us find it hard to make progress in life, spiritual life, business, or family is that we need to be either not focusing on things, focusing on too many things, or not focusing on the right things. We all have goals, whether or not we write them our or not. Our goals are make clear by the time that we spend doing things. I will find it helpful to create balanced scorecard for life so that I can make note of the things in life that I want to grow in in four categories: Personal, Spiritual, Family, Work </p>]]></description>
