description: 'If you’re reading this, I’m assuming that you’re in the group that wants to make a positive and meaningful impact on the world. I too am part of Generation Y looking to make my impact on the world. When I graduated from my undergraduate at Olivet Nazarene University, I flew out of the gate filled with ambition and passion to make my mark on the world. I just needed people to influence and a group to lead. Then I realized that the world doesn’t change very fast, and I wasn’t leading a group, so all that “making my mark” dream was rudely confronted by reality. Well, it’s a bit harder than I thought. So, what’s the plan? Do we take John Mayer’s advice and wait for the world to change? '

If you're reading this, I'm assuming that you're in the group that wants to make a positive and meaningful impact on the world. I too am part of Generation Y looking to make my impact on the world. When I graduated from my undergraduate at Olivet Nazarene University, I flew out of the gate filled with ambition and passion to make my mark on the world. I just needed people to influence and a group to lead. Then I realized that the world doesn't change very fast, and I wasn't leading a group, so all that "making my mark" dream was rudely confronted by reality. Well, it's a bit harder than I thought. So, what's the plan? Do we take John Mayer's advice and wait for the world to change?
