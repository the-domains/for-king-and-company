I desire to make progress in areas of my life and the distractions of life can assuage me and take my eye off the ball of what’s really important.

I think the reason that many of us find it hard to make progress in life, spiritual life, business, or family is that we need to be either not focusing on things, focusing on too many things, or not focusing on the right things.

The more that I live life the more that I realize that we can get easily distracted with all of the things in life. I desire to make progress in areas of my life and the distractions of life can assuage me and take my eye off the ball of what's really important. I realize just how important it is to simplify what I'm doing in my life. The idea of the balanced scorecard has been coming to my mind recently in the way that I've been appreciating simplicity. I think the reason that many of us find it hard to make progress in life, spiritual life, business, or family is that we need to be either not focusing on things, focusing on too many things, or not focusing on the right things. We all have goals, whether or not we write them our or not. Our goals are make clear by the time that we spend doing things. I will find it helpful to create balanced scorecard for life so that I can make note of the things in life that I want to grow in in four categories: Personal, Spiritual, Family, Work 

For simplicity, I will choose two goals under each of the four categories: 

Spiritual 

Humility 

Wisdom 

Personal 

Spanish vocabulary - reading the newspaper 

Clear communication - with Elizabeth and with others 

Family 

Growing in marriage 

Telling ourselves the truth 

Work 

Talking to potential customers 

Patent application 

The best thing is, this can sort of become my prayer list as long as I have it. I can pray through each of the items on the list and ask the Lord's grace over them and that he would give wisdom and insight into these items. Although I can switch them out at any time, there is obvious value in sticking with the items on a list for a period of time so that progress can actually occur. If I'm continually substituting there is no value because there is no longer-term time investment. 

I also need to ask myself, if these are the strategic goals, what is the operational and tactical component of each one of these? Where does the rubber meet the road? "Growing in marriage" is an awesome strategic goal... but what does that look like? What are the steps involved in working toward achieving that? I must think through the operational and tactical in order for this to work and be meaningful. 

This also becomes a template for how I spend my time throughout my day. If I attest that I want to become a more productive person and grow in Christ and in other areas, then I should act in a way that furthers one of these items. As time goes on, I can measure the impact and note the progress. I can even keep track of balanced scorecards throughout the years and see what was on it and what was on my mind at the time and see how the Lord has answered the prayers and requests of each one!
